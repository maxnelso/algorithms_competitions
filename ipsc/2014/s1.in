To be, or not TO be: that IS THE QUESTION:
WHETHER 'TIS NOBLER in the mind to suffer
THE slings AND ARROWS of outrageous FORTUNE,
OR TO take arms against A SEA OF TROUBLES,
AND by OPPOSING END THEM? To DIE: TO SLEEP;
NO MORE; AND BY A SLEEP TO say WE END
The heart-ache AND THE thousand NATURAL shocks
THAT FLESH IS HEIR TO, 'TIS a CONSUMMATION
DEVOUTLY TO be wish'D. TO die, TO sleep;
TO SLEEP: perchance TO DREAM: AY, there'S THE rub;

ONCE UPON a midnight DREARY, WHILE I PONDERED weak AND WEARY,
OVER many A QUAINT AND curious VOLUME OF FORGOTTEN LORE,
While I NODDED, NEARLY NAPPING, SUDDENLY THERE CAME a TAPPING,
As OF some one GENTLY rapping, rapping AT MY CHAMBER door.
'Tis SOME VISITOR,' I MUTTERED, 'TAPPING AT my CHAMBER door -
ONLY THIS, and NOTHING more.'
AH, DISTINCTLY I REMEMBER IT WAS IN THE BLEAK DECEMBER,
AND EACH separate dying EMBER WROUGHT its GHOST UPON the floor.
EAGERLY I WISHED the MORROW; - vainly I HAD SOUGHT TO BORROW
FROM MY books SURCEASE of SORROW - sorrow FOR THE lost Lenore -
FOR the RARE and RADIANT MAIDEN whom THE angels NAME LENORE -
NAMELESS HERE FOR EVERMORE.
AND THE SILKEN sad UNCERTAIN RUSTLING OF EACH PURPLE curtain
Thrilled me - FILLED me with FANTASTIC TERRORS NEVER FELT BEFORE;
SO that NOW, TO still THE beating OF MY heart, I stood REPEATING
'Tis SOME VISITOR ENTREATING ENTRANCE AT MY chamber door -
Some late visitor ENTREATING ENTRANCE at my CHAMBER DOOR; -
This IT IS, and NOTHING MORE,'
PRESENTLY MY soul GREW STRONGER; hesitating THEN NO LONGER,
'SIR,' SAID I, 'OR MADAM, truly YOUR FORGIVENESS I IMPLORE;
BUT THE fact IS I was napping, AND SO gently YOU came rapping,
AND so FAINTLY YOU CAME TAPPING, tapping at MY CHAMBER door,
That I SCARCE WAS SURE I HEARD YOU' - here I OPENED WIDE the DOOR; -
DARKNESS there, and NOTHING MORE.
Deep INTO THAT darkness PEERING, LONG I stood THERE WONDERING, FEARING,
DOUBTING, DREAMING DREAMS NO MORTAL EVER DARED to dream BEFORE;
BUT THE SILENCE was UNBROKEN, AND THE darkness GAVE NO token,
AND THE ONLY WORD THERE SPOKEN was THE WHISPERED WORD, 'Lenore!'
This I whispered, AND AN ECHO MURMURED back the WORD, 'LENORE!'
Merely THIS and NOTHING MORE.
Back INTO the CHAMBER TURNING, ALL MY soul WITHIN me burning,
SOON AGAIN I HEARD A tapping SOMEWHAT LOUDER than BEFORE.
'Surely,' SAID I, 'SURELY that is SOMETHING at my WINDOW LATTICE;
LET ME SEE then, WHAT THEREAT IS, AND THIS MYSTERY EXPLORE -
LET MY HEART BE still A MOMENT AND this mystery EXPLORE; -
'TIS the WIND AND NOTHING MORE!'
OPEN HERE I flung the SHUTTER, WHEN, with MANY A FLIRT AND flutter,
IN THERE STEPPED a STATELY RAVEN OF THE SAINTLY DAYS OF yore.
NOT THE LEAST obeisance MADE HE; NOT a minute STOPPED OR stayed HE;
BUT, WITH mien OF LORD or lady, PERCHED above MY chamber door -
PERCHED UPON a BUST OF Pallas just ABOVE my CHAMBER door -
PERCHED, and SAT, and NOTHING MORE.

66
THEN THIS ebony BIRD BEGUILING MY sad FANCY INTO SMILING,
By the GRAVE AND STERN DECORUM OF the countenance IT WORE,
'THOUGH THY crest BE SHORN AND SHAVEN, THOU,' I SAID, 'art sure NO CRAVEN.
Ghastly GRIM AND ANCIENT RAVEN WANDERING FROM THE NIGHTLY SHORE -
Tell me what THY LORDLY name IS on THE NIGHT's PLUTONIAN SHORE!'
QUOTH THE RAVEN, 'NEVERMORE.'
MUCH I MARVELLED this UNGAINLY FOWL to HEAR discourse SO PLAINLY,
Though ITS ANSWER LITTLE meaning - little RELEVANCY BORE;
For WE CANNOT HELP agreeing that NO living human being
EVER yet WAS blessed WITH SEEING bird ABOVE HIS chamber door -
BIRD OR BEAST ABOVE THE sculptured BUST ABOVE his chamber DOOR,
With SUCH NAME as 'NEVERMORE.'
BUT THE RAVEN, SITTING lonely on the PLACID BUST, SPOKE ONLY,
That one WORD, as IF HIS SOUL in that ONE WORD HE did outpour.
NOTHING further THEN HE UTTERED - NOT A FEATHER THEN he fluttered -
TILL I SCARCELY more than muttered 'Other FRIENDS have flown before -
ON the MORROW he will LEAVE me, as MY hopes HAVE FLOWN BEFORE.'
THEN THE bird SAID, 'NEVERMORE.'
STARTLED AT THE stillness broken BY reply SO APTLY SPOKEN,
'DOUBTLESS,' SAID I, 'WHAT IT utters IS ITS ONLY stock and STORE,
CAUGHT FROM SOME unhappy MASTER WHOM UNMERCIFUL DISASTER
FOLLOWED FAST and followed FASTER till HIS SONGS ONE BURDEN BORE -
TILL the dirges of HIS hope that melancholy BURDEN BORE
OF "NEVER-NEVERMORE."'
BUT THE RAVEN STILL beguiling ALL my SAD SOUL INTO SMILING,
STRAIGHT I WHEELED a CUSHIONED seat in front OF BIRD and BUST AND DOOR;
Then, UPON THE velvet sinking, I BETOOK MYSELF TO linking
FANCY UNTO FANCY, THINKING what THIS OMINOUS BIRD OF YORE -
What THIS GRIM, UNGAINLY, ghastly, gaunt, AND OMINOUS bird OF YORE
MEANT IN CROAKING 'NEVERMORE.'
THIS I SAT ENGAGED IN GUESSING, but no SYLLABLE expressing
To the fowl whose FIERY EYES now burned INTO MY BOSOM'S CORE;
This AND MORE I SAT DIVINING, WITH MY HEAD AT EASE reclining
ON THE CUSHION'S velvet LINING that THE LAMP-light GLOATED O'ER,
BUT WHOSE velvet VIOLET LINING WITH THE lamp-light GLOATING O'er,
HE SHALL press, AH, nevermore!
THEN, methought, THE air GREW DENSER, perfumed FROM AN UNSEEN CENSER
SWUNG BY SERAPHIM WHOSE FOOT-FALLS tinkled ON the tufted FLOOR.
'WRETCH,' I CRIED, 'thy GOD HATH lent thee - BY THESE ANGELS HE has SENT thee
Respite - respite and nepenthe FROM THY MEMORIES OF Lenore!
QUAFF, OH QUAFF THIS KIND NEPENTHE, AND forget THIS LOST Lenore!'
Quoth THE RAVEN, 'NEVERMORE.'
'PROPHET!' SAID I, 'THING OF EVIL! - prophet still, IF BIRD or DEVIL! -
WHETHER TEMPTER sent, or WHETHER TEMPEST TOSSED THEE HERE ashore,
Desolate YET ALL UNDAUNTED, on THIS desert land enchanted -
ON THIS home BY HORROR HAUNTED - tell ME TRULY, I IMPLORE -
IS THERE - IS THERE balm IN GILEAD? - TELL me - TELL ME, I IMPLORE!'
QUOTH THE RAVEN, 'NEVERMORE.'
'PROPHET!' SAID I, 'THING OF EVIL! - PROPHET STILL, IF BIRD OR DEVIL!
BY THAT HEAVEN that BENDS above us - BY that God WE both ADORE -
TELL THIS SOUL WITH sorrow laden if, WITHIN the distant AIDENN,
IT SHALL clasp A SAINTED MAIDEN WHOM the ANGELS name LENORE -
Clasp A RARE and radiant MAIDEN, WHOM the ANGELS NAME LENORE?'
QUOTH THE raven, 'NEVERMORE.'
'BE THAT WORD our sign OF PARTING, BIRD or FIEND!' I SHRIEKED UPSTARTING -
'GET thee back INTO THE tempest AND the NIGHT'S PLUTONIAN SHORE!
LEAVE NO BLACK PLUME AS a TOKEN OF that LIE THY SOUL hath spoken!
LEAVE MY loneliness unbroken! - QUIT THE bust above MY door!
Take THY beak from OUT MY heart, AND take THY form FROM OFF MY DOOR!'
QUOTH THE raven, 'Nevermore.'
AND THE raven, NEVER FLITTING, still IS SITTING, STILL IS SITTING
ON THE pallid bust OF PALLAS JUST above MY chamber DOOR;
AND his EYES HAVE ALL THE seeming OF a DEMON'S THAT IS DREAMING,
AND THE lamp-LIGHT o'ER him STREAMING throws his shadow ON the FLOOR;
AND MY soul FROM OUT that shadow that LIES floating ON THE FLOOR
SHALL be LIFTED - nevermore!

WHOSE woods these are I THINK I know. 
HIS HOUSE IS IN the VILLAGE, though; 
HE WILL NOT see ME stopping here 
To WATCH HIS woods fill UP WITH SNOW. 
MY LITTLE HORSE must THINK it'S QUEER 
To STOP WITHOUT a farmhouse NEAR 
BETWEEN THE WOODS AND FROZEN LAKE 
THE DARKEST EVENING OF the YEAR. 
HE GIVES HIS HARNESS BELLS A SHAKE 
TO ASK IF THERE'S SOME mistake. 
THE ONLY other sound'S THE SWEEP 
Of EASY wind AND DOWNY FLAKE. 
THE WOODS are lovely, DARK, AND DEEP, 
But I HAVE PROMISES to KEEP, 
AND miles to GO before I SLEEP, 
AND miles TO go BEFORE I SLEEP.

ALL the WORLD'S A stage,
AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN MERELY PLAYERS;
THEY HAVE THEIR EXITS AND THEIR entrances,
And ONE man IN HIS TIME PLAYS MANY parts,
HIS acts BEING seven AGES. At FIRST, THE infant,
Mewling AND puking in the NURSE'S ARMS.
THEN the whining SCHOOLBOY, WITH his SATCHEL
AND shining morning FACE, CREEPING LIKE SNAIL
UNWILLINGLY to school. And then THE LOVER,
SIGHING LIKE FURNACE, WITH A woeful ballad
MADE to HIS MISTRESS' eyebrow. THEN a SOLDIER,
Full OF STRANGE OATHS AND bearded LIKE THE PARD,
Jealous IN honor, SUDDEN AND QUICK in QUARREL,
Seeking the BUBBLE reputation
EVEN IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. AND THEN THE JUSTICE,
IN fair round belly WITH GOOD CAPON LINED,
With eyes SEVERE AND BEARD OF formal cut,
FULL of WISE saws AND MODERN INSTANCES;
AND so he plays HIS PART. The SIXTH AGE shifts
INTO THE lean AND SLIPPERED pantaloon,
WITH spectacles on nose and POUCH on SIDE;
HIS YOUTHFUL HOSE, WELL saved, A WORLD TOO wide
For his shrunk shank, and HIS BIG MANLY voice,
TURNING AGAIN TOWARD CHILDISH TREBLE, PIPES
AND WHISTLES IN HIS SOUND. LAST SCENE OF ALL,
THAT ENDS THIS STRANGE EVENTFUL HISTORY,
IS SECOND CHILDISHNESS AND MERE OBLIVION,
Sans TEETH, SANS eyes, SANS TASTE, SANS everything.

THERE is ANOTHER SKY,
EVER SERENE and FAIR,
AND there is another SUNSHINE,
THOUGH IT BE darkness THERE;
NEVER mind FADED FORESTS, AUSTIN,
NEVER MIND SILENT FIELDS -
HERE is A LITTLE forest,
Whose LEAF IS ever GREEN;
HERE IS A brighter garden,
WHERE not A FROST has been;
In ITS unfading FLOWERS
I HEAR THE BRIGHT bee HUM:
PRITHEE, my brother,
Into MY GARDEN come!

'TWAS THE night BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE
NOT a CREATURE WAS STIRRING, NOT even A MOUSE;
THE stockings WERE HUNG BY the chimney with CARE,
IN HOPES that ST. NICHOLAS soon would be THERE;
THE CHILDREN WERE NESTLED all snug IN their BEDS;
WHILE VISIONS OF SUGAR-plums DANCED IN their HEADS;
And MAMMA IN HER 'KERCHIEF, AND I in my CAP,
HAD JUST settled our BRAINS FOR A long WINTER's NAP,
WHEN out on THE LAWN there arose SUCH A CLATTER,
I sprang FROM my BED TO see what WAS the MATTER.
AWAY to the WINDOW I FLEW LIKE A flash,
TORE OPEN THE SHUTTERS and THREW UP THE sash.
The moon ON the breast of the NEW-FALLEN SNOW,
GAVE A lustre OF MIDDAY to objects BELOW,
WHEN WHAT TO my wondering EYES DID APPEAR,
BUT A MINIATURE sleigh AND EIGHT TINY rein-deer,
WITH A LITTLE old driver SO LIVELY and QUICK,
I KNEW IN A moment HE MUST BE ST. Nick.
More RAPID than eagles HIS COURSERS they came,
AND HE WHISTLED, AND shouted, AND called THEM BY NAME:
"NOW, DASHER! NOW, DANCER! NOW Prancer AND VIXEN!
ON, COMET! on, CUPID! on, DONDER AND Blixen!
TO the top OF THE PORCH! TO THE TOP OF THE WALL!
NOW DASH AWAY! DASH AWAY! DASH AWAY all!"
AS leaves THAT before the wild hurricane fly,
WHEN THEY MEET with AN OBSTACLE, MOUNT TO THE SKY;
So UP TO THE HOUSETOP THE coursers THEY FLEW
With THE SLEIGH full OF toys, and St. Nicholas too-
And THEN, IN A twinkling, I HEARD ON the ROOF
THE PRANCING AND PAWING OF EACH little hoof.
As I drew in my head, AND WAS TURNING AROUND,
Down THE CHIMNEY St. Nicholas CAME WITH A BOUND.
HE WAS dressed ALL IN fur, FROM his HEAD TO HIS FOOT,
And his CLOTHES WERE ALL tarnished WITH ASHES AND SOOT;
A BUNDLE OF toys he HAD flung ON his BACK,
AND HE LOOKED LIKE A PEDLER JUST OPENING his PACK.
HIS eyes-HOW THEY TWINKLED! HIS dimples, how merry!
HIS CHEEKS were LIKE roses, HIS NOSE LIKE A CHERRY!
HIS DROLL little MOUTH was drawn UP LIKE A BOW,
And THE BEARD ON his chin WAS AS white AS the SNOW;
THE STUMP OF a PIPE HE HELD TIGHT IN HIS teeth,
And THE SMOKE, it ENCIRCLED HIS head like a WREATH;
HE HAD a BROAD FACE AND A LITTLE round belly
That SHOOK WHEN HE LAUGHED, like a bowl full of JELLY.
HE WAS CHUBBY AND PLUMP, A RIGHT JOLLY OLD elf,
AND I LAUGHED when I SAW him, IN SPITE OF MYSELF;
A wink of HIS EYE AND a TWIST OF his HEAD
SOON gave ME TO KNOW I HAD nothing TO DREAD;
He SPOKE NOT A WORD, BUT WENT STRAIGHT TO his WORK,
AND filled ALL the STOCKINGS; THEN TURNED WITH A JERK,
AND laying HIS finger ASIDE OF his NOSE,
AND GIVING a nod, UP the chimney HE ROSE;
HE sprang to HIS SLEIGH, TO HIS team GAVE a WHISTLE,
AND AWAY THEY all flew LIKE THE DOWN OF A thistle.
BUT I HEARD HIM exclaim, ERE HE DROVE OUT OF SIGHT-
"HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO all, AND TO ALL A GOOD night!"

I'll tell YOU the STORY OF CLOONY THE Clown
Who worked IN A circus THAT came THROUGH town.
HIS SHOES WERE TOO BIG AND his hat WAS too SMALL,
BUT HE just WASN'T, just WASN'T FUNNY at ALL.
HE HAD A TROMBONE TO play LOUD silly TUNES,
HE HAD a GREEN DOG and A THOUSAND BALLOONS.
He was floppy AND sloppy AND SKINNY AND TALL,
But HE just WASN'T, JUST wasn'T FUNNY AT ALL.
AND every time HE did A TRICK,
EVERYONE FELT A LITTLE sick.
AND EVERY TIME HE told a JOKE,
Folks sighed as IF THEIR HEARTS were broke.
AND every TIME he LOST A SHOE,
EVERYONE LOOKED AWFULLY BLUE.
And EVERY time HE STOOD ON HIS HEAD,
Everyone screamed, "GO BACK TO BED!"
AND every time he MADE A LEAP,
EVERYBODY fell asleep.
AND every time HE ATE HIS TIE,
EVERYONE BEGAN TO CRY.
And Cloony COULD NOT make ANY MONEY
SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS NOT FUNNY.
ONE day he SAID, "I'll TELL THIS TOWN
HOW it FEELS TO BE AN UNFUNNY CLOWN."
AND HE told THEM ALL WHY HE LOOKED SO SAD,
AND he TOLD them all why HE felt SO BAD.
HE TOLD OF Pain AND Rain and COLD,
He TOLD OF DARKNESS IN his soul,
AND AFTER HE finished his TALE OF WOE,
DID EVERYONE cry? Oh no, no, NO,
They LAUGHED UNTIL THEY SHOOK the trees
WITH "Hah-Hah-Hahs" AND "HEE-HEE-HEES."
THEY LAUGHED WITH HOWLS AND YOWLS and shrieks,
THEY laughed all day, they LAUGHED all WEEK,
THEY LAUGHED UNTIL THEY had a FIT,
THEY LAUGHED UNTIL THEIR jackets SPLIT.
The LAUGHTER SPREAD for MILES AROUND
To EVERY CITY, EVERY TOWN,
OVER MOUNTAINS, 'CROSS the SEA,
FROM Saint Tropez TO MUN San NEE.
And SOON THE WHOLE WORLD rang with LAUGHTER,
LASTING TILL forever AFTER,
WHILE Cloony stood in the CIRCUS TENT,
WITH HIS HEAD DROOPED low AND HIS SHOULDERS BENT.
AND HE SAID,"THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT -
I'M FUNNY JUST BY ACCIDENT."
AND while THE WORLD LAUGHED OUTSIDE.
CLOONY THE Clown SAT DOWN AND cried.

NAKED you ARE simple AS ONE OF YOUR HANDS;
SMOOTH, earthy, small, transparent, ROUND.
YOU'VE MOON-LINES, apple pathways
NAKED you ARE SLENDER as a NAKED GRAIN OF WHEAT.
NAKED you ARE BLUE AS A NIGHT in CUBA;
YOU'VE vines AND STARS IN YOUR HAIR.
NAKED YOU ARE spacious and yellow
AS SUMMER IN A GOLDEN church.
Naked YOU are tiny AS ONE OF your nails;
Curved, subtle, ROSY, TILL the DAY is BORN
AND YOU WITHDRAW to THE underground WORLD.
As IF down A LONG tunnel of CLOTHING AND of chores;
Your clear light DIMS, gets DRESSED, DROPS ITS leaves,
And becomes a NAKED HAND again.

The SHADES of night were falling FAST,
AS THROUGH AN ALPINE village passed
A YOUTH, WHO bore, 'MID SNOW AND ICE,
A BANNER with THE STRANGE DEVICE,
EXCELSIOR!
HIS brow WAS SAD; HIS EYE BENEATH,
Flashed like A FALCHION from ITS sheath,
AND LIKE a SILVER CLARION rung
THE ACCENTS OF that UNKNOWN TONGUE,
EXCELSIOR!
In HAPPY HOMES he SAW THE LIGHT
OF HOUSEHOLD FIRES GLEAM WARM AND BRIGHT;
ABOVE, the SPECTRAL GLACIERS SHONE,
AND FROM HIS LIPS escaped A groan,
EXCELSIOR!
"TRY NOT THE Pass!" THE OLD MAN SAID:
"Dark LOWERS the TEMPEST overhead,
The ROARING torrent is DEEP AND WIDE!
And LOUD that clarion VOICE replied,
EXCELSIOR!
"OH stay," THE MAIDEN SAID, "AND REST
Thy weary HEAD upon THIS breast!"
A tear stood IN his bright blue EYE,
BUT STILL he answered, WITH a SIGH,
EXCELSIOR!
"BEWARE the PINE-TREE's withered BRANCH!
BEWARE THE AWFUL AVALANCHE!"
THIS was THE peasant'S last Good-NIGHT,
A VOICE REPLIED, FAR UP the HEIGHT,
EXCELSIOR!
AT BREAK OF DAY, AS HEAVENWARD
The pious monks of SAINT BERNARD
UTTERED THE OFT-repeated prayer,
A VOICE CRIED THROUGH THE STARTLED AIR,
Excelsior!
A TRAVELLER, BY THE FAITHFUL HOUND,
HALF-BURIED in THE snow was FOUND,
STILL grasping in his HAND OF ICE
THAT BANNER with THE STRANGE DEVICE,
EXCELSIOR!
THERE IN the twilight COLD AND GRAY,
Lifeless, but BEAUTIFUL, HE LAY,
And FROM the SKY, SERENE AND FAR,
A VOICE fell, like A FALLING STAR,
Excelsior!
